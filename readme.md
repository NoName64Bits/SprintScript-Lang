<h2>SprintScript</h2>

This is the 43B test of the SprintScript language
It's fully functionally but i won't put the compiler/interpreter here until it' finished, maybe it's bugged out

if it doesn't run how it should... Call 911 :) No, i am kidding, just put a issue on this git
Before you run it, please be sure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and at least .net framework 3.5
